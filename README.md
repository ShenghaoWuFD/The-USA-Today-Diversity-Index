# The-USA-Today-Diversity-Index
Calculate the USA diversity index and show it up on map

## Overview
The USA TODAY Diversity Index is a number – on a scale from 0 to 100 – that represents the chance that two people chosen randomly from an area will be different by race and ethnicity. In more personal terms: “What is the chance that the next person I meet will be different from me?” A higher number means more diversity, a lower number, less. In this project, I downloaded race data in different states from the U.S. Census. Then calculated the diversity index and visualized it on the U.S. map.
